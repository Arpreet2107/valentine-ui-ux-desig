My Love Story in Code: A Figma Valentine's Day Design This year, instead of roses and chocolates, I'm coding my way into my crush's heart! This Figma project is a heartfelt web design, brimming with interactive elements and playful animations, all crafted to ask the special someone in my life to be my Valentine.
